# etsy-javascript-scraper-bookmarklet
This is a bookmarklet that can scrape the values from etsy's order details page and copy to your clipboard.

As etsy has deprecated v2 API, we don't have any API endpoint to get data for our purchased orders.
Using this scraper, we can save a lot of manual work.
